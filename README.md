Inspired by [countmeinbot](https://github.com/whipermr5/countmeinbot).

This is a bot to poll for attendance for weekly events, intended for separate Telegram groups of regular and casual members. It has polling features (with waitlisting) and attendance taking features.

It's still in development.
